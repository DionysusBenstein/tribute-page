                        The tech visionary graduated from Princeton with a major
                        in computer science and electrical engineering. Upon
                        graduating, he turned down job offers from companies
                        such as Intel and Bell Labs to join a startup called
                        Fitel. He went on to launch a news-by-fax service
                        company with Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET. After
                        the venture failed, Bezos became the youngest senior
                        vice president at a hedge fund called D.E. Shaw, working
                        his way up the ranks in just four years.

                    <p>
                        Bezos could have stayed on Wall Street for the rest of
                        his career if he hadn't been enthralled by the knowledge
                        that by 1994, the internet was growing at the rate of
                        2,300% annually. Soon enough, his idea for Amazon was
                        born, and the CEO began making a list of 20 possible
                        product categories to sell online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Amazon.com, then a platform for selling books, grew in
                        its early stages out of a garage with a pot-belly stove.
                        Bezos, who put his own $10,000 in the company comprised
                        of himself, his wife and two programmers, ironically
                        conducted most of his meetings at the neighborhood
                        Barnes & Noble. Within its first month after launch in
                        July 1995, Amazon sold books in every state in the U.S.
                        and 45 countries around the world.

                <div class="section__text">
                    <p>
                        During Amazon's first year, Bezos tried to raise money
                        by predicting $74 million in sales by 2000, far
                        underestimating the reality: $1.64 billion in sales in
                        1999 alone. He managed to gather $1 million in seed
                        funding from angel investors after using up investment
                        from his family, primarily from his parents, who chipped
                        into a significant portion of their life savings.
                        According to the CEO, the first 20 or so outside
                        investors in Amazon put in about $50,000 each for a
                        stake of less than 1%. Each investment would now be
                        worth around $6 billion, representing a 120,000 times
                        return, given the investors held onto their entire
                        stakes and that they had never been diluted by later
                        investors. In June 1996, Amazon raised another $8
                        million in Series A from venture capital firm Kleiner
                        Perkins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Amazon went public in May 1997 and turned out to be one
                        of the few startups that survived the dot-com bust. As
                        the platform diversified its product offerings and
                        solidified itself as a market leader and pioneer, annual
                        sales skyrocketed from $510,000 in 1995 to over $3
                        billion in 2001. In 2013, Bezos revealed his first plans
                        for the company's revolutionary Amazon Prime
                        subscription business, with Amazon Prime Air, which
                        would use drones to deliver to customers.

                    <p>
                        The company's share price reflects this phenomenal
                        growth. The stock increased nearly 500% from September
                        2015 to September 2020 and rose 60% between January and
                        September of 2020 alone. Bezos owned about 15.1% of the
                        two decade-old company as of 2020, making it the biggest
                        source of his wealth. Between 2017 and 2019 Bezos sold
                        more than a million shares and also distributed
                        additional shares to his ex-wife as part of divorce
                        proceedings. The 2020 Annual Meeting announcement showed
                        Bezos owning 75.0 million shares.

                        Bezos also has substantial holdings in more traditional
                        investments such as real estate. His 165,000-acre Corn
                        Ranch in Texas was acquired as the base of operations
                        for his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and serves as
                        the test site for the vertical-landing manned suborbital
                        New Shepard rocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His personal real estate includes holdings on both the
                        east and west coast. Bezos has two multi-million dollar
                        homes in Beverly Hills and a 10,000-square-foot
                        apartment in the Century Tower in Manhattan that cost
                        him just under $10 million. Bezos' New York presence is
                        reported to have boosted Century Tower property values
                        even higher, with space selling for $2,000 to $3,000 per
                        square foot. He also has a lakeside property in
                        Washington State, on which he spent $28 million to
                        increase the living space to almost 30,000 square feet.

                    <p>
                        In 2012, Amazon bought its own South Lake Union
                        headquarters building in Seattle for $1.5 billion,
                        instantly making the company one of the city's largest
                        commercial property owners. Amazon took possession of
                        nearly a dozen buildings, almost 2 million square feet
                        of office space and approximately 100,000 square feet of
                        retail space. Also in 2012, the company spent about $200
                        million to purchase a three-block area in downtown
                        Seattle that is being developed as office tower space.
                        In 2014, Amazon spent another $50 million to pick up one
                        more square block. In August 2017, the Seattle Times
                        reported that Amazon had just as much office space as
                        Seattle's next 40 largest employers combined.

                        Bezos has also invested very sizable sums in giving back
                        through charitable donations. In addition to the Bezos
                        Family Foundation that funds several education projects,
                        Bezos has made individual multimillion-dollar charitable
                        contributions to the Seattle Museum of History and
                        Industry, as well as to his alma mater, Princeton
                        University.

                        In January 2018, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie,
                        announced a $33 million dollar donation to TheDream.US,
                        an organization working to improve college access for
                        undocumented immigrant youth who were brought to the
                        United States as young children. The grant will provide
                        college scholarships to 1,000 US high school graduates

                        Bezos has an affinity for the technology sector, for
                        media and communication services that facilitate
                        connecting people, and also for just what he considers
                        to be potentially profitable investments. In the media
                        and communications sector, Bezos has invested in
                        Twitter, Inc. and has committed nearly $50 million in
                        venture capital to the popular business news website
                        Business Insider. He acquired The Washington Post in
                        2013 for $250 million. TeachStreet, Inc., ZocDoc, Inc.,
                        and Nextdoor are all platforms for connecting people in
                        which Bezos has invested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the travel sector, Bezos has invested $112 million
                        and $35 million, respectively, in series B financing of
                        Airbnb and transportation service Uber. Bezos is a big
                        believer in the cloud, as evidenced by Amazon's major
                        push into providing cloud computing services. However,
                        his investment interest does not end with his own
                        company. One of his notable investment successes is
                        Workday, Inc., a company that provides human resource
                        services in the cloud. Shortly after Bezos' venture
                        capital investment in the company, it went public in an
                        initial public offering (IPO) that garnered $684
                        million. In the sphere of a more traditional retail
                        business, Bezos has also invested in Glassybaby, a
                        company that makes glass-blown holders for votive
                        candles.
