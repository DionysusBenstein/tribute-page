                        The tech visionary graduated from Princeton with a major
                        in computer science and electrical engineering. Upon
                        graduating, he turned down job offers from companies
                        such as Intel and Bell Labs to join a startup called
                        Fitel. He went on to launch a news-by-fax service
                        company with Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET. After
                        the venture failed, Bezos became the youngest senior
                        vice president at a hedge fund called D.E. Shaw, working
                        his way up the ranks in just four years.

                        Bezos could have stayed on Wall Street for the rest of
                        his career if he hadn't been enthralled by the knowledge
                        that by 1994, the internet was growing at the rate of
                        2,300% annually. Soon enough, his idea for Amazon was
                        born, and the CEO began making a list of 20 possible
                        product categories to sell online.

                        Amazon.com, then a platform for selling books, grew in
                        its early stages out of a garage with a pot-belly stove.
                        Bezos, who put his own $10,000 in the company comprised
                        of himself, his wife and two programmers, ironically
                        conducted most of his meetings at the neighborhood
                        Barnes & Noble. Within its first month after launch in
                        July 1995, Amazon sold books in every state in the U.S.
                        and 45 countries around the world.

                        During Amazon's first year, Bezos tried to raise money
                        by predicting $74 million in sales by 2000, far
                        underestimating the reality: $1.64 billion in sales in
                        1999 alone. He managed to gather $1 million in seed
                        funding from angel investors after using up investment
                        from his family, primarily from his parents, who chipped
                        into a significant portion of their life savings.
                        According to the CEO, the first 20 or so outside
                        investors in Amazon put in about $50,000 each for a
                        stake of less than 1%. Each investment would now be
                        worth around $6 billion, representing a 120,000 times
                        return, given the investors held onto their entire
                        stakes and that they had never been diluted by later
                        investors. In June 1996, Amazon raised another $8
                        million in Series A from venture capital firm Kleiner
                        Perkins.

                        Amazon went public in May 1997 and turned out to be one
                        of the few startups that survived the dot-com bust. As
                        the platform diversified its product offerings and
                        solidified itself as a market leader and pioneer, annual
                        sales skyrocketed from $510,000 in 1995 to over $3
                        billion in 2001. In 2013, Bezos revealed his first plans
                        for the company's revolutionary Amazon Prime
                        subscription business, with Amazon Prime Air, which
                        would use drones to deliver to customers.

                        The company's share price reflects this phenomenal
                        growth. The stock increased nearly 500% from September
                        2015 to September 2020 and rose 60% between January and
                        September of 2020 alone. Bezos owned about 15.1% of the
                        two decade-old company as of 2020, making it the biggest
                        source of his wealth. Between 2017 and 2019 Bezos sold
                        more than a million shares and also distributed
                        additional shares to his ex-wife as part of divorce
                        proceedings. The 2020 Annual Meeting announcement showed
                        Bezos owning 75.0 million shares.
